        <h2>What Exactly is this?</h2>
        <p>First of all, thank you for visiting this experimental project that I've been working on. In its essence, "Dungeon Chest" is a web 3D rendering 
            engine that allowed me to visualize how 3D objects, lighting, JSON models, textures and animations would interact in a simple 
            browser window. It turned out to be quite the task to program this environment and at the same time stylize it under an "Adventure" theme.
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            Use your mouse together with left and right click. It doesn't require any keyboard input!
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements for Correct Validation</h2>
        <p>
            Since this project utilizes SVG files please set your validator to CSS3 + SVG for correct validation
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>I can write an entire research paper on the engine behind this project, but in short: it uses a 3D Web GL based JS framework "THREE.js" which
            simplifies a lot of the calculations neccessary for a 3D scene with perspective rendering, but most importantly, it enables the possibility of adding lighting. 
            I encorporated multiple JSON files (Built a separate script that converted 3D models into JSON) that allow the engine to produce 3D models on screen.<br>
            For animations I prioritized simple tools like built in css keyframe transitions, but for in scene animations I utilized a library called "TWEEN.js",
            which made my life rotating and translating object on triggered events so much easier. Lastly, for some of the controls I used pre-made libraries like "ORBITCONTROLS.js"
            as they fit my project like a glove. Lastly, the entirety of the 3D code runs on a server so it requires a server configuration to run the scripts.
        </p>
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            As with all 3D Engines, this one isn't perfect. Due to margin adjustments for example there is no proper way in THREE.js to adjust the raycaster
            so that the collisions would be as precise as possible. As a result there occasional incorrect collisions. This effect is especially visible
            on the item selection scene where you'd have to go a little out of bounds in order to select something on the sides.<br>Another small, but present problem,
            is the difficulty of optimizing the website for mobile. The project runs without problems, but due to the way the THREE.js library works it's very hard to adjust 
            UI elements to be mobile-friendly. It's a task for the future that I hope to be able to fix at one point!
        </p>
        <h2>How I went Above and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
            The actual fact of dealing with THREE.js deserves a medal, as the documentation pages for it are HEAVILY outdated and the majority of the scripts 
            are deprecated. Otherwise, I've stepped up my design game and created a large amount of 2D/3D assets found in the project. (the ones not made by me are listed in Resources).
            The rest of my above and beyond lies within the programming of the 3D scenes where I made sure that I was able to fit the "adventure theme" and making the project as 
            optimized as possible through WebGL. I played a lot with lighting settings and shadow calculations in order to get the best looking output. And, I've also utilized JQuery for 
            some of the UI elements that are present within the simulation. I've managed to squeeze in a particle system, that both looks nice, but also showcases how 
            performant correctly written particle systems can be. Lastly, I've used a Sound.js Library that allowed me to play hearthstone audio effects very efficiently, which is quite a good alternative to HTML audio. 
        </p>
        <h2>Future Developments Planned</h2>
        <p>
            Currently there is a place holder right underneath the render view. There I planned to add a way for the adventurer to pick a specific location on the map for him to explore throught the render view.
            The 'x' mark selection will always be at one point for now. This effect was achieved by moving around svg elements, which in their turn could also be animated!
        </p>
        <h2>Conslusion</h2>
        <p>
            I would say this was one of the hardest projects I've ever attempted and the experience of programming 3D Graphics is invaluable to me. Even though I might have not been able to accomplish
            some of the stretch goals that I've set out for myself, this project holds a lot of room for incredible additions and improvements and partially that was my goal.
            In the future, I hope to return to this project with an abundance of new features and by continuing to work on it I will increase my level of 3D Graphics development even further beyond!
